# Frontend

## Webpack

Webpack makes it relatively easy to compile and minify your application's 
CSS and JavaScript files. However, you are not required to use it 
while developing your application; 
you are free to use any asset pipeline tool you wish, or even none at all.

**Installation Instructions:**
