# Validation

There are different approaches to validate your application's incoming data.

## Form and JSON validation

This project comes with [cakephp/validation](https://github.com/cakephp/validation) +
[selective/validation](https://github.com/selective-php/validation) and contains some usage examples.

The `cakephp/validation` component is needed to validate complex form data (arrays) against a specific set of rules, 
and the `selective/validation` component collects the validation errors, throws validation exceptions
and transforms the result into a proper JSON response.

## OpenAPI validation

The [league/openapi-psr7-validator](https://github.com/thephpleague/openapi-psr7-validator)
package can validate PSR-7 messages against OpenAPI (3.0.x) specifications expressed in YAML or JSON.

The [justinrainbow/json-schema](https://github.com/justinrainbow/json-schema) package is
for validating JSON structures against a given schema.

## JSON schema validation

The [league/json-guard](https://json-guard.thephpleague.com/) package lets you validate JSON data
using [json schema](https://json-schema.org/).

## XML validation

The [DOMDocument::schemaValidate](https://www.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.schemavalidate.php)
method is able to validate XML files against a XSD schema.

## Assertions

The [webmozart/assert](https://github.com/webmozart/assert) and
[beberlei/assert](https://github.com/beberlei/assert)
package provides assertions to validate method input/output with nice error messages.
